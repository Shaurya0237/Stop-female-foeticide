<p class="txt">One group estimates more than 10 million female foetuses may have been illegally aborted in India since 1990s, and 500,000
girls were being lost annually due to female foeticide. MacPherson estimates that 100,000 abortions every year continue to be
performed in India solely because the fetus is female. </p><br>

  Although efforts have been made over the years by the Indian government to empower women socially, economically,
and politically, enactment of legislation has been difficult to implement due to the vastness of the country, the
wide distribution of the female workforce, lack of education and literacy, and the indifferent attitude of government bureaucracy.

<p class="txt">
  Women of India have nothing to say in shaping the economic and political space in which they live. It is imperative
  that their thoughts and visions, intuitive skills, concrete and effective participation in development, and their deep
  aspiration for a more peaceful world be considered to help catalyze the will for the transformation of systems and
  structures into pathways of equality, development and peace.

  Every change on the planet starts with a new state of consciousness, a new awareness, and a new vision. The main
  thrust of our organisation's programs is to create a new development paradigm, which is the result of a new awareness to set the
  motion for women's empowerment programs and worldwide culture for empowering women by mobilizing NGOs, governments
  and the media to spread the women welfare awareness and educate the public at large on effective measures like human
  right to equality, peace, health care & improved opportunities, protective skills and their right to dignity.
